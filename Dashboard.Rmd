some plotly examples
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

NYC airbnb data

```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)

```

## Make a scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
   mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = .5
  )
```

## plotly boxplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")

```

## plotly bar chart

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, 
    y = ~n, 
    color = ~neighbourhood, 
    type = "bar", 
    colors = "viridis"
    )
```

## ggplotly

```{r}
scatter_ggplot = 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  coord_cartesian()
scatter_ggplot

ggplotly(scatter_ggplot)

```
